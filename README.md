# Crowdsourcing VR Demo
This demo is meant to demonstrate the capabilities of the "Crowdsourcing VR" project. This project combines virtual reality with realtime input through sms messaging to trigger events in game. The following demo can be installed onto an Oculus Quest through the use of the completed APK or built into a desktop executable using the included unity files.
